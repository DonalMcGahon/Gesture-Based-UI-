# **Gesture-Based-UI**
Project for Gesture Based UI Development

## **Purpose of the application:**
Design of the application including the screens of the user interface and
how it works. The application can be an experimentation process for you, testing how pieces of
hardware could interact or be combined with gestures. You don’t have to solve the world economic
crisis just yet.

## **Gestures identified as appropriate for this application:**
Consider how gestures can be incorporated
into the application, making a justified argument for the ones that you pick. This is a research
element for the project.

## **Hardware used in creating the application:**
You are not limited to the hardware listed above. If
you have your own hardware, or hardware simulator that you wish to use, then feel free. The
purpose of each piece of hardware should be given with a comparison to other options available.

## **Architecture for the solution:**
The full architecture for the solution, including the class diagrams,
any data models, communications and distributed elements that you are creating.

## **Conclusions & Recommendations:**
Conclusions are what you have learned from this project and
the associated research. Recommendations are what you would do differently if you were to
undertake the project again. The Reflective Piece – what I learned and “enjoyed”
